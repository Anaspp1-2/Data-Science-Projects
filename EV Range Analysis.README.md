# Electric Vehicle Range Analysis

Overview
This project delves into the analysis of electric vehicle (EV) ranges. Our objective is to understand the factors influencing the range of EVs and to perform a comprehensive analysis based on these factors. This analysis will provide insights into optimizing EV performance and extending their range.

Project Structure
The project consists of several key components:

Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, including manufacturer specifications, real-world driving data, and environmental conditions.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Preparing the collected data for analysis by removing inconsistencies and filling in missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through statistical summaries and visualizations.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features that can improve the accuracy of our analysis.

Model Building and Evaluation: Developing and evaluating models to predict EV range based on the identified features.

Results and Insights: Summarizing the findings and providing actionable insights for EV manufacturers and users.

Data Collection
We sourced our data from multiple avenues:

Manufacturer Specifications: Official data from EV manufacturers, including battery capacity, efficiency, and range estimates.

Real-World Driving Data: Data collected from EV users, which includes driving habits, terrain, speed, and weather conditions.

Environmental Data: Information on temperature, wind speed, and other environmental factors impacting EV performance.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning process involved:

Handling Missing Values: Using interpolation and other techniques to fill gaps in the data.

Removing Duplicates: Ensuring there were no repeated entries.

Standardizing Units: Converting all measurements to standard units for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:

Visualize Relationships: Scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps were used to understand relationships between variables.

Identify Outliers: Box plots and z-scores helped in spotting anomalies in the data.

Statistical Summaries: Mean, median, standard deviation, and other metrics were calculated for each variable.

Feature Engineering
We created additional features such as:

Energy Consumption Rate: Calculated based on distance traveled and battery capacity.

Weather Impact: Derived features representing the impact of temperature, wind, and precipitation on range.

Driving Behavior: Metrics like acceleration, deceleration, and average speed.

Model Building and Evaluation
Several models were developed and evaluated:

Linear Regression: To understand linear relationships between variables.

Random Forest: For capturing non-linear interactions.

Neural Networks: To leverage complex patterns in the data.

Evaluation metrics included Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.

Results and Insights
Our analysis provided several key insights:

Battery Capacity: A primary determinant of EV range.

Driving Behavior: Aggressive driving significantly reduces range.

Temperature: Extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) can adversely affect battery performance.

Terrain: Hilly terrains lead to higher energy consumption compared to flat terrains.

Conclusion
This project underscores the importance of a holistic approach to understanding and optimizing EV range. By considering factors such as driving habits, environmental conditions, and vehicle specifications, we can make more informed decisions to enhance the efficiency and performance of electric vehicles.

Future Work
Future directions for this project include:

Incorporating More Data: Expanding the dataset with more real-world driving scenarios.

Advanced Modeling Techniques: Exploring advanced machine learning algorithms for better predictions.

Real-Time Analysis: Developing systems for real-time range estimation and optimization based on current conditions.
